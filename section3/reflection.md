## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
S.M.A.R.T. specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound goals are completely new and resonated with me.
Zone of proximal development was also a new idea, the ability to learn by just barley being pushed outside of your comfor zone.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I think i currently demonstrate the growth mindset because i enjoy seeking out challenges, but i am not good at asking for help.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Arrays are used to hold a collection or a list of things. Arrays could be used on something such as facebook where a collection of pictures are stored. Or AirBNB where a collection of places and locations are stored

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method directly effects an element within the collection. It could remove or add to the array without having to manually go back and change it.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Loops check a condition and if it returns true, it will continue to run until it returns false. If you use a loop in conjunction with an array it can check a list of data and perform an action depending on the evaluation of the data. If a loop is used on its own, it can be used for counting or repeating a codeblock a set 'n' amount of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is an action that is done until it cant be done anymore. eg: If you're checking all the nesting boxes in a chicken coop one by one, every time you find an egg you can move on to the next box, but once you reach and empty box you must stop.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Can i be defined by two conditions? such as 3 < i < 10
