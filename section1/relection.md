## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
Super learners view learning as a process and have a continuous improvement and growth mindset. I would like to implement more breaks in my learning process.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
integers: data using numbers
floating point: data with a fractional number (decimal)
strings: data with characters, integers or special characters
Booleans: data representing true or false


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log('Hello World!');


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// for single line comments
/* for comments that will extend over one multiple lines */
A code comment is a place where you can explain what the code is doing/trying to do, so you can understand or so someone who is looking at your code can understand


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable stores a value temporarily and can be used in multiple places. Let a box represent the variable, and what you put in the box (a favorite toy) be the variable quantity (or what defines the variable)

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
name/content/data. Instagram uses variables to store user name, amount of followers and amount of people following.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is used to join things together with a + sign. Can put together variable quantity and strings


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Google could use concatenation when logging in, it would use a variable to store your name and then Hello as a string, showing 'Hello Emili' when logging in. 

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
If interpolation is generally easier to read in longer strings, why would anyone ever use concatenation?
