## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I generally wait too long to ask a question. I think from the articles I read in part A, I've come to understand that asking questions will always be embarrassing but you have to learn to let it not be-- timing and clarity is very important when asking questions.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I enjoyed feeling comfortable and confident in exploring how to open node by myself. If I forgot, I could go back to section1. Exploring outside resources while learning functions was interesting because it was explained in different ways. I think the different explanations were helpful as well as having to problem solve questions I was having by putting my new found Googling skills to the test.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement first evaluates the condition and the provides an outcome depending on if the statement is true.
IF its cold outside, put a jacket on, ELSE don't wear a jacket.
A conditional is probably used in all web applications that require you to log in. If username and password are entered correctly, log in, else ask them to try again.


1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To add multiple conditions to an if statement, you use if/else if/else, in that order. The program will read the first if, and if it evaluates to false it will move on to the next else if statement, and if that evaluates as false it will move on to the else statement which has no other set parameters other than the fact that the first two statements had to be false first.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

&& checks if two conditions are met and || can check if 1 of 2 conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Can interpolation be used instead of concatenation in a function with arguments and parameters?
