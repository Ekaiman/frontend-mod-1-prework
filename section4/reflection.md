## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

Workflow this week felt good. The pomodoro technique  made me feel like i was retaining information better since I was taking small breaks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

My intention was to stay more focused on my task. Sometimes the pomodoro technique made me stay on track but other times I would still get distracted. More frequent breaks seemed to increase my productivity overall. Sometimes it was hard to leave the computer when the timer went off.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Objects stores things with characteristics or properties, and an array stores a list or a collection of items.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array, all the entities are the same.

  * List of states and their capitals
  Object would store states and capitals well, because the capital could be seen as a characteristic or property of the state.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array, its a single group of items.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array, a list of all the account names.

  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object, each student could be stored as a key and they cohort as a value. Easy to change if cohorts change.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  Object, so it can store ingredient and amount.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array, similar entities in one list.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
An object in Excel could be seen in the form of a bill being due.
Billing Date = '11/4/21'
amount = '84.50'
service dates = '10/1-11/1'

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Is there an easy way to remember the syntax for a class vs and object?
Class uses = but object uses :
